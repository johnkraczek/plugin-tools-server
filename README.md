# Welcome to Plugin Tools Server by YDTB!

If you are a wordpress agency that deals with a lot of plugins you know how diffictult it can be to keep everything up to date. Tracking updates for plugins, themes, and more can be a chore. There are some amazing projects out there that certanly help with making developing for wordpress a lot easier. For starters check out [Trellis by roots](https://roots.io/trellis/). They make it easy to develop locally, push remotely, and keep everything tracked with composer to specify what plugins / themes / wordpress version are used and compatable. There's only one problem with that ecosystem. **Paid Plugins**. For the open source plugins you have wpackagist-plugins and wpackagist-themes, but theres not a simple way to include ALL your paid plugins simply, until now. 

This is one piece that I have been iterating on for the last two years, and here are some of my requirements:

 - Ability to track licenced paid plugins easily by putting them under git version control. 
 - Automatically update the plugin repository when there is a new version available, and tag that version.
 - Small fast client side plugin that can live on client sites to watch when there is an update for a whitelisted (licensed) plugin and then report that there is an update to a server plugin. 
 - A server plugin that can recieve webhook notifications when there's a new plugin version and push those updates into the git service provider (Bitbucket for now)
 - Authentication to bitbucket is only handled by the server so that there is only one host with credentials to push to the git service provider. Additionally this wont be a client site so there's no chance some client will mess things up. 
 - The server plugin will provide a composer package.json file so that you can add the server as a composer repository and get access to all of the plugins via composer. 
 - Ability for the server package.json to specify both dist and source urls for the plugins. This allows you to use the dist url for production sites, and the source url if you are actively developing the plugin. 
 - Authentication for downloading plugins happens between composer and bitbucket so there's less need for securing the plugin tools server. 


# Plugin Tools Server

There are two wordpress plugins that work together here. The **Plugin Tools Server Plugin** lives on one of your subdomains for example https://composer.example.com. This server plugin handles recieving plugin updates & then unzips those updates into the right place so that it can track what changes have happened and then push those changes up to bitbucket. 

## Authentication

The Plugin Tools Server needs to be able to push to your bitbucket account, I would recommend setting up a separate project such as "Wordpress Packages" or "WP-Packages" so that all of the plugins are co located in your bitbucket account. Then you will need to [setup an app password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-app-password/) with only read & write permissions. You can then add those to the settings after activating the plugin. 

## WP-CLI
All of the actions you can do in the interface are also available via the CLI
### Fetch Repositories From Workspace. 

     wp pts fetchAll

This will initially pull all of the repositories from your bitbucket project, and clone them to your server. Depending on how many plugins you have it may take a few minutes.
